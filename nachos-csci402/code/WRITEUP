I. Requirements

	This assignment requires the students to implement system calls to handle
	multithreaded user programs. Additionally, the system calls should hande
	multiprogramming by allowing multiple processes (up to a determined maximum)
	to run concurrently. The system calls that were required were Exec, Fork,
	Yield, Exit, CreateLock, DestroyLock, CreateCondition, DestroyCondition,
	Acquire, Release, Wait, Signal, Broadcast, and a replacement for printf
	(ours is Printx). These system calls must allow multithreaded user programs
	to execute, but prevent them from accessing kernel data directly or
	otherwise threatening the security of the operating system. 
	
	Secondly, the assignment requires conversion of the previous project's
	museum code (which ran as part of the operating system, using C++) to a user
	program. This involves eliminating all calls to the functions replaced by
	our system calls, print statements using printf, and C++ code. The museum
	is to run consistently as a multithreaded user program, as well as run
	alongside a second museum process as a stress test of both multithreading
	and multiprogramming.


II. Assumptions

	We make the assumption that no more than five user processes will be run at
	any given time, as the MAX_PROCESSES defined in userprog/exception.cc is
	five. Because a bitmap wasn't used to hold the current processes, the 
	operating system runs five processes only. This means that new process can't
	run after the fifth process completes because the array is maxed out (spaces
	in the process table are not reused). We also assume that the user programs
	will use less than MAX_LOCKS (500) locks and MAX_CONDITIONS (500)
	conditions in total, as the spaces in the lock table and condition table are
	not reused and no more than the maximum amount of locks and conditions can 
	be created. Finally, we assume that the user programs can fit in 
	numPhysPages (2000) of memory.

III. Design

	This design needs to support multiprogramming so our museum can be run
	multiple times in parallel by the user.
	In order to do this, we need to implement system calls like CreateLock,
	Acquire, etc.
	In these system calls, we need to protect the data, for processes can
	disrupt other processes.
	To protect this data, we will implement locks around all shared data.
	We also need to ensure multiprogramming is enabled so we need to
	reconstruct the address space constructor.
	The address space constructor assumes each virtual page matches up with the
	same physical page.
	However, we needed to change this so that each virtual page gets mapped to
	any available physical page.
	This will enable us to run up to five processes in our code.
	We will have to also ensure the data is being read from the appropriate
	places as well.
	Locks and CVs need to be specific to each process, so we need to ensure
	that each process only grabs the locks and CVs they use.
	We had to make some adjustments since we were using C programming.
	We created our own Printx statement to show output.
	We also had to make a little random function to simulate randomness.
	We had to find a new way to create the parameters we previously passed our
	threads, so we generated that in each thread as it was forked.
	Our museum is designed using while wait loops so that each thread can be
	signalled when necessary.
	We followed the documentation to implement all system calls.
	We added some extra parameters such as a name to fork, but soon found out
	that it would not be needed.
	We used structs to hold all the information we needed about locks, CVs, etc.

V. Testing

	Syscall 
	testing:		AcquireLock_Syscall
					- Tests the AcquireLock_Syscall by attempting to acquire
					locks using various incorrect indexes, which fails. Then the
					test creates a new lock and acquires it successfully. The 
					test attempts to acquire the lock again and fails. Then, 
					a non-owner process attempts to acquire the lock and fails.
					Finally, a third test creates and destroys a lock, then
					attempts to acquire it, and fails.
					
					Execute: From userprog, run nachos -x ../test/acquirelock
					
					Test output:

				Broadcast_Syscall
					- Tests the Broadcast_Syscall by attempting to broadcast on
					a CV belonging to another process, which accordingly fails
					(wrong process test). Then tests various invalid indexes for
					both the lock and condition, which fails until given a
					correct index (non-normative test). Then tests broadcasting
					on a destroyed lock and CV, which fails (destroyed test).
					Then begins a test with two waiting threads and one
					broadcaster, which proceeds normally and succeeds 
					(normative test).

					process attempts to destroy the CV a second time, which
					fails. Then a non-owner process attempts to destroy a CV

				DestroyLock_Syscall
					- Tests the DestroyLock_Syscall by attempting to destroy a 
					lock with various invalid indexes, which fails. Then, the
					test creates and acquires a lock and attempts to destroy it,
					which fails because a thread should not destroy a lock that
					it owns. Then the test releases the lock and destroys it 
					successfully. It attempts to destroy the lock again, which
					fails. The test creates a second lock, and a second process
					attempts to destroy it and fails.
					
					Execute: From userprog, run nachos -x ../test/destroylock

				ReleaseLock_Syscall
					- Tests the ReleaseLock_Syscall by attempting to release a
					lock using various invalid indexes, which fails. Then it
					creates a lock, and attempts to release without acquiring,
					which fails. The test acquires the lock successfully, then
					releases it successfully. It attempts to release the lock
					a second time, which fails. A second test creates a new
					lock, and a third test attempts to acquire it but fails
					because the lock belongs to a different process. A fourth
					test creates and acquires two locks, then creates a
					condition and successfully waits on it. A second thread of
					the fourth process acquires the remaining lock, destroys the
					two previous locks, signals with the last lock, releases
					the lock, and shows that locks are successfully deleted.

				Signal_Syscall
					- Tests the Signal_Syscall by attempting to signal on
					a CV belonging to another process, which accordingly fails
					(wrong process test). Then tests various invalid indexes for
					both the lock and condition, which fails until given a
					correct index (non-normative test). Then tests signalling
					on a destroyed lock and CV, which fails (destroyed test).
					Then begins a test with one waiting thread and one
					signaller, which proceeds normally and succeeds (normative 
					test).
					
					Execute: From userprog, run nachos -x ../test/signal

VI. Discussion

	Experiment 
	expectation:
					We expect that the system calls will work properly, of
					course. The stress test - running two museums - should
					also work in the sense that two museums running concurrently
					should not interfere with each other, cause errors, or 
					otherwise behave differently than a single museum running
					within the operating system. Of course there will be
					differences in the program, but these should not be apparent
					to the user. 
					
	Experiment
	result:			The museum simulation works very well, especially in a 
					uniprogrammed environment. We saw no issues running the 
					converted museum code as a single process. We did see some
					problems with running the museum in a multiprogrammed 
					environment. Running two museums concurrently revealed some 
					flaws within our design.
	
	Explanation:		We first dealt with a simple problem - not enough physical
					pages! After increasing numPhysPages sufficiently, we 
					discovered that the index variable for the lock table was a 
					global in exception.cc - bad news! After changing that, 
					and fixing some problems with the indexes that were given to
					each museum function (Visitor(), CarDriver(), etc.), we 
					realized that there are some existing race conditions in the
					museum. These race conditions are rare enough that they
					don't show up in our tests in a uniprogrammed environment,
					but the additional context switching that results from a 
					multiprogrammed environment is enough to show that these 
					race conditions can occasionally rear their ugly heads. We
					estimate that the race conditions appear in 10% of our
					multiprogrammed tests. 
					

VII. Miscellaneous

	We wrote bash scripts to do most of the conversion from C++ to C code using
	the syscalls, though our knowledge of scripting is quite limited. For this
	reason, the museum code is badly formatted (not indented, multiple
	statements on one line, etc.). We apologize for the lack of readability 
	and are willing to provide the scripts we used if necessary.
